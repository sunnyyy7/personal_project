# Overview

What you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning:
- Learn the Basic C++, and apply some of the concepts about C++ into a code programe.

Description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language:
- To-Do List Manager: Build a console-based to-do list application. Allow users to add, remove, and view tasks.

Purpose for writing this software:
- Write one or more programs in C++ that might demonstrates of Variables, Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Classes, or Data structure from STL (such as a vector, list, or map)

Link to your YouTube demonstration. (It takes around 4 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code, it shared what you learned about the language syntax.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Item 1: Could be more user freidly. (Found out the menu options instrction would be a little confusing)
- Item 2: Have a better format like spacing.
- Item 3: More function or abiltity in the programe. Like edit date abd time...etc
