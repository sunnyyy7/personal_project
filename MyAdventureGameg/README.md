/* # Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C# language.}
The provided software is a text-based adventure game set in the Harry Potter Wizarding World. 
It is written in C# and is designed to run in a console environment. 
The game allows the player to navigate through different locations within Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, 
make choices, and experience various magical scenarios.



{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

The purpose of writing this software is to showcase the use of C# programming language for creating a simple interactive game. 
The game demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, decision-making using switch statements, 
looping for gameplay, and the use of functions to modularize the code. Additionally, 
it features a save and quit functionality to persist player progress.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}: VS code, youtube, w3school website

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}

The primary programming language used for this software is C# (C Sharp). C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft, commonly used for building Windows applications, web applications, and games.

In this case, the code does not explicitly mention the use of external libraries. 
The game relies on the core functionality provided by the C# language itself, 
utilizing basic input/output operations and file handling. 
The code showcases the inherent capabilities of C# for building console-based applications without the need for extensive external libraries.
