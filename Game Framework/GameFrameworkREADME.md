# Overview

What you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning:
- Learn the Basic pygame settings, and learn how to use pygame in VS code.

Description the game that you wrote, and explain how to play your game:
- Snake Game: Develop a Snake game, where players control a growing snake to eat food and avoid collisions.

The purpose for writing this software:
- Write a simple game using a Python game framework (e.g. PyGame or Arcade) or a more complex platform such as Unity or Unreal. The game will demonstrated display graphics, take user input from the keyboard or mouse, moveable objects. It might also demonstrated Allowing the user to save and load the game, add music or sound effects to the game, and provide levels in your game that change the difficulty of the game.

Link to your YouTube demonstration. It takes around 4 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code, it shared what you learned about the language syntax.

# Development Environment

1. The tools that you used to develop the software:
- VS code

2. The programming language that you used and any libraries.
- Python

# Future Work

List of things that need to fix, improve, and add in the future:

* Item 1: More user friendly, like displaying timer, levels...etc
* Item 2: The graphic could be more facy and professional. (It just have the basic color and graphic for now)
* Item 3: When the snake eat the food, it will level up. But it didn't show the difficulties or levels.
