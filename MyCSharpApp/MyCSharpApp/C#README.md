# Overview

What you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning:
- Learn the Basic C#, and apply some of the concepts about C# into a code programe.

Description of the software that demonstrate the C# language:
- Text Adventure Game: Develop a text-based adventure game where players make choices to progress through the story.

Purpose for writing this software:
- Write one or more programs in C++ that might d of Variables, Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Classes, Structures and Unions.

Link to my YouTube demonstration. It takes around 4 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code, it shared what you learned about the language syntax.
