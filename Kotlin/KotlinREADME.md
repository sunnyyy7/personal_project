What you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning:
- Learn the Basic Kotlin, and apply some of the concepts about Kotlin into a code programe.

Description of the software that demonstrate the Kotlin language:
- Basic Calculator: Create a basic calculator application with support for arithmetic operations and user-friendly input handling.

Purpose for writing this software:
- Write one or more programs in Kotlin that might d of Variables, Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Classes...etc

Link to your YouTube demonstration. It takes around 4 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code, it shared what you learned about the language syntax.
